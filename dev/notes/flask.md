# Flask server


```
$ pip install Flask
$ FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run
 * Running on http://localhost:5000/
```

Alternatively you can use python -m flask:

```
$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ python -m flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

>This launches a very simple builtin server, which is good enough for testing but probably not what you want to use in production. For deployment options see Deployment Options.
